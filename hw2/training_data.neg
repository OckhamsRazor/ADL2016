this fake passport drops to the ground
and after watching this movie , you 'll wholeheartedly agree
and singer sinead o'connor appears rather effectively as the virgin mary who occasionally gives francis advice
i ca n't imagine anyone with a reasonable attention span being more than momentarily distracted by this pointless adventure
hughley -RRB- is the same type of character as zoot the suit from my favorite martian
there 's still 100 minutes to go
they had characters who talked with funny accents in an attempt to make you laugh
we start off in a high-class california high school where every student resembles a supermodel in the making
these women arrive at jimmie 's location and immediately start bullying him about what he 's looking for in a woman
plenty , unfortunately
for urban legend 2 i humbly suggest a donald duck costume

however , certain rules should apply to film , and one of those is consistency of character
despite a gross of good intentions , brandon lee 's final film does n't fly very high

that brings the local sheriff -LRB- brendan gleeson -RRB- and a fish-and-game warden -LRB- bill pulman -RRB- to investigate
eldard is good in his role , but is limited by the plot
there are some serious problems in louis mellis 's and david scinto 's script that should have been caught before filming
the other good part of the film is the sexual confrontation between arquette and rose mcgowan
they are not creatures , but phenomenas
a lot of it is so cheesy that no one could possibly accept it as reality
russell is buffed-up and does a credible job but it 's not much of a challenge
one of jaws ' great scenes involved the would-be-ahabs drinking and singing songs and telling stories
at first the movie moves along at a quick , interesting pace
or more the point , anyone that allows him to bask in his own less-than-subtle presence
the sad thing is that end of days had so many things going for it
now you listen to me , youngster
battlefield long , boring and just plain stupid
each episode was like a chaplin silent movie

he does it well , i guess , but this is no alfie
-LRB- his first lol line is to ms bullock : i 'd like to boogie with you -RRB-

2 , 3 , and 4
they also pay him a lot of cash
just kidding
it 's not light enough to be fun , or mean enough to be intense

virus takes itself seriously
todd mcfarlane himself executive produced this disappointing misfire and even appears in a cameo

kyle maclachlan must have been promised a big pay-day or his standards have dipped since appearing in blue velvet
murphy is delightful and the film takes off whenever he 's onscreen
it 's not a funny scene , and the whole thing comes off rather uncomfortably

matthew modine plays joe , a struggling actor waiting tables in order to pay the rent
you ca n't have any of this

but that was 1962 and 1964 respectively

the plot , obviously , centers around computer hacking
this is strictly a take-the-money-and - run operation
armageddon is not as terrible movie as godzilla
he wants more to life than just digging away underground for the colony
the high school comedy seems to be a hot genre of the moment

moving right along , the film plays off every stereotype our culture has ever learned regarding african tribes
what happens if jerry gets mad he asks
when fern discovers what has happened , the fab 3 make her an offer she ca n't refuse make-up
needless to say , murphy shows little , if any , promise or imagination as a screenwriter

many important scenes seem too dark ; the lighting could have been improved significantly
there 's nothing great from him here just a good performance that owes as much to presence as ability
even the editing seemed to boast a campy quality
there is no big plot description in this review , because the movie has very little plot
this story has a shocking twist and a tragic end that i did not see coming
his daughter was taken away from him and he anguishes this loss every day of his life

the one-two punch was started in the summer , with the release of batman forever
i would actually highly recommend this film if it satirized all of this
or that fighter planes are still in pristine condition after all that time and gassed up
any of this sound familiar
it 's up to joel to make it fun though

and you can not do that without studying
kathleen turner plays an uninteresting talent agent
stalked 's cast is uniformly adequate : not anything to write home about but also not all that bad either
but then , i doubt if kingpin will have anything to do with it
it also means that you have to pay attention
intelligent writing , which is evident early on , is replaced by hackneyed drivel
then there 's the tone of the movie
the film 's most innovative twist is the makeover of fern mayo
this alone is enough to retitle the movie babe wire
the hairstyles are retro too , straight from the frankie avalon , annette funicello school of fashion
some will argue that our hero does not have a killer instinct , the hell with that

it is this primitive schoolboy mentality that eventually kills the movie
why
the film began
a lot , and mike giggling like a loony
yes , it 's put that bluntly
chris ellis , as spader 's self-important colleague , is the only cast member who manages to be convincing

i woke up early the day i died ' is a perfectly bad film
to put it bluntly , ed wood would have been proud of this
was it a whim
first off , the screenplay by series creator chris carter is sloppy and cliched
although she ends up nowhere near a believable character , she does add some humor to the film
this is screenwriting
it 's as if they just whacked someone on the head , pointed at him and said , see
these are among the many problems that plague never been kissed
in that film , they worked to propel the narrative
scant existing story background confuses matters even worse and adds to the growing list of unanswered questions
perhaps carrey can take solace in the fact that his supporting actors fare no better
instead , the king and i will just go down as among the year 's worst

no one is going to enrich their life or have a good time by watching material such as this
after these credits , a snapshot of actor jay underwood appears
if you want to be surprised , do n't read , i am going to reveal the ending
rarely has a movie left me with such an utter feeling of emptiness

music pretty much accompanies the film the entire time
or something like that
freeway is a modern retelling of little red riding hood
and god help me if i ca n't get enough of those in an aimless drama
of course , no one was expecting much of a plot from this movie anyway
julie and one other , ray -LRB- freddie prinze jr -RRB- , survived only to make this dismal sequal

supposedly this is a horrible thing
the acting is ok
remember how stupid that looked

take for example casablanca
when the gallows beckoned , it was sweet release indeed
there 's the demanding producer
not that there is much of a romance to begin with

let 's get on a plane home
one of the most respected names in american independent filmmaking is john sayles
and the bad guy is a drug lord
where to begin with this painfully poor thriller
analyze this is slow , unfunny , and badly acted
none of these successfully capture the originals
as director , ginty did very little to improve that impression
making a movie entirely about criminals does n't necessarily mean they have to be unlikable and cliche cutout characters
how will patients be transported to the free clinic
now you 're probably thinking to yourself : is this really how bad cruel intentions is

speaking of one past criminal apprehension , jackson 's superior yells , you tore his arm off
this sounds just like another film i saw last year , the limey
cindy does a surprisingly good job here in her first movie
speed 2 could do without dialogues
the film spends an hour on this kind of stuff , building to its climax
this film does n't seem to know what to do with itself
one can only hope they were rewarded handsomely for acting in this hopelessly muddled picture
4 why make this a comedy , instead of an emotional , rocky-style drama
they are about style and energy and synergy between actors

producer jerry bruckheimer fails with armageddon
not even charlize theron being naked would get me to sit through this movie again
unfortunately it does n't get much more formulaic than one tough cop
why else would they indulge in petty squabbling while they watch their friends become fish food
but there 's nothing else
even the best effects ca n't seem to save the most pathetic of movies these days
go right ahead
well now i know
a sensuous romantic comedy , about as appealing as your average lightweight tv sitcom
but we never understand why her character makes such pathetically bad decisions and
black guy
something just made me feel compelled make the choice -RSB-
it is rated pg for violence and profanity and would be acceptable for kids around ten and up
recently it seems that hollywood does n't feel the need to even re-write the script
funny , that is if you are n't comparing them to the likes of tarantino 's pulp chcaracters
morgan freeman , again , is utterly wasted with a ridiculously underwritten role
an example : that -LSB- car crash -RSB- must 've been awful for
the film ends as this angel -LRB- -RRB-
ahh , what a cynical time we live in
or is it just for mental patients
the lines the actresses come out with are completely horrible
shall we go back to basics
pathetic
after some provoking nick does oblige , but problems continue for kate
of course , not everything goes entirely to plan
this film reaches a level that transcends the so bad it 's good level and borders on the downright insane
and we never get more than a superficial clue as to why gere has had this flash of insight
on top of that debacle , the whole end of the film is an anticlimatic sequence in scaramanga 's funhouse
so the rest of the time we are treated to patrick , played with little zest by lazard
i once heard someone describe the films of italian schlock horror director lucio fulci as dim-witted
disc two features the never before seen director 's cut of the film , which runs 138 minutes long
but there 's one redeeming feature about this failure of a movie : the special effects
again , it 's not a character we 're seeing on the screen , it 's david suchet

i would strongly advise anyone not to see this movie
obviously , hardball is a strikeout of a movie that never gets the bat anywhere near the ball
that 's it

it gets boring at times to tell you the truth
during their trip across the stormy sea , their boat suffers an incident and requires repairs
any movie with a hurdle that large to overcome had better be pretty damn good otherwise

they are given official skull paddles
he says that what really matters in life is community
we see glimpses of greatness , but ` any given sunday ' has its agenda all tangled in technical gobbledy-gook
one of jaws ' great scenes involved the would-be-ahabs drinking and singing songs and telling stories
the most important thing is that we 've seen it before and it was a lot better
why any person would think of such a thing is beyond me , but things do get worse
she 's all that has the dubious distinction of being the worst movie i 've seen so far this year
the second lamest device , of course , is the , oh , it was all a dream resolution
if only silvio had worked or been allowed to work a little longer on the script
or , maybe all career politicians are like that

we will be in three different locations instantaneously : sydney , the american southwest , and seville
the movie 's other top name is a much better actor , but that does n't save meet joe black
* * * = excellent show
it 's difficult to find anything in the film that does work
and trust me , the rest of the 2 hours are not worth it
he also tries for the love of maid marian and attempts to overthrow the evil sheriff of rottingham
and forsythe more than once threatens his family
at one point , he looms over the crew and says the anaconda is the perfect killing machine
but night of the creeps might make a nice addition to a b-movie horror marathon
the lack of gusto is the movie 's major stumbling block
nothing works out as planned - it fails both to entertain and to enlighten
james bond
what we 're left with is a string of unanswered questions that do n't make any sense
jeff goldblum gets the lion 's share of screen time and his tired storyline weighs the proceedings down
oh , pretty woman
not at all
all the other story tangents are as frazzled as a cokehead trying to solve a rubick 's cube
consider such curiosities

it looks nicer , and has fewer plot-holes within its equally ludicrous framework
i 'm not an overly cynical guy

the picture unknowingly affirms that oscars transform nuanced talent into overwrought expressionists

in movies like contact , the special effects serve the story
her boyfriend , michael -LRB- jon bon jovi -RRB- , is broke and in a dead end job
that 's not the case here
never too soon , the movie did conclude in a very simple , disappointing way
the set design and visual effects are all arresting
the rugrats movie is doa from the start
it 's the last thirty minutes of the movie , then , that wrecks the film
we never even see the monstrous squid or the menacing storm

obi-wan , a character i was really looking forward to learning more about , is even less interesting
there 's too much about sue that does n't make sense
this is really sad considering how good the first fright night film was
in the third , he instigated small war in order to avenge the old friend
as the parrot , mohr is delightful when director john roberts allows him to cut up
they attack by the hundreds and the next strike will come soon
but the rest of the film is dull , boring and singularly uninteresting
end of days is not only silly and confusing , but it 's also distinctly unpleasant to watch
the only times that the mod squad comes even close to working is in its comedic moments
will everyone in the town turn against the coach
as if that was n't enough , the story suffers from major problems in logic
they fall in love and eventually marry
what happens

loud and obnoxious hard rock fused with drum loops dominate some scenes
confusingly composed , the movie jumps about jarringly as it tells its story
one moment they 're in the present time , the next moment , they 're in italy in the 1600s
for as good a comic book as it is , spawn did not spawn a good movie
well , annoyingly unprofessional
and what about this wasted cast
-LRB- think charlie and irene will fall in love
on television , fan culture must impose its meanings on the text because there is nothing there & nbsp ;

one of the earliest apparent problems with ` rules of engagement ' is its lack of credibility
i have no idea why liam neeson took this role
